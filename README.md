## üöÄ Core Features & Highlights

-   **Fully Responsive Design:** Built from the ground up to be mobile-first, using CSS Flexbox and Media Queries to ensure a seamless experience on all devices, from mobile phones to widescreen desktops.
-   **Dynamic Course Filtering System:** An interactive "Courses" page implemented with **vanilla JavaScript** that allows users to dynamically filter and view subjects based on both the **academic field** (e.g., "Network & Software", "Mechanical Engineering") and **grade level** (10th, 11th, 12th).
-   **Animated Infinite Scroll Gallery:** A visually engaging image gallery featuring a smooth, continuous horizontal scroll effect created purely with **CSS animations**.
-   **Interactive Staff Carousel:** A custom JavaScript-powered carousel to showcase school staff members, complete with next/previous controls and slide indicators.
-   **Modal Pop-ups:** Displays detailed information for each staff member in a clean, elegant modal window, preventing page reloads and enhancing user experience.
-   **Modern UI/UX Elements:** The design incorporates modern CSS effects, including hover animations, custom checkboxes, and a sleek, intuitive layout to create a professional and user-friendly interface.
-   **Semantic HTML5:** The project uses semantic HTML tags (`<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`, etc.) to improve SEO and accessibility.
